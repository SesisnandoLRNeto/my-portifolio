        Description
      </Heading>
      <P>
        I&apos;ve worked with Angular and Node.js frameworks, leveraging a
        comprehensive set of methodologies and tools to deliver high-quality
        software solutions. My current focus is on developing an Enterprise
        Mobility Management (EMM) system, encompassing various critical aspects
        such as CI/CD, code practices, and leadership roles like Chapter Leads.
        My approach includes:
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Agile Methodologies: </strong> <br />
        Expert in both Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven
        Development (TDD) to ensure continuous delivery and iterative progress.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Domain-Driven Design (DDD): </strong> <br />
        Applying DDD principles to create robust and scalable architectures that
        align closely with business needs, particularly within the EMM domain.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong> Unit Testing: </strong> <br />
        Utilizing Jasmine and Karma to build and maintain a solid suite of unit
        tests, ensuring code reliability and performance within the EMM system.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Automation Testing: </strong> <br />
        Proficient with Protractor and Selenium to automate end-to-end testing,
        enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process, crucial
        for maintaining the integrity of the EMM platform.
        <br />
        <br /> <strong>CI/CD & Code Practices: </strong> <br />
        Actively involved in implementing CI/CD pipelines and best coding
        practices to streamline development and deployment processes, ensuring
        consistent and high-quality software delivery. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Chapter Leads: </strong> <br />
        Leading and mentoring teams in best practices, fostering collaboration
        and continuous improvement across the development lifecycle.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>AWS: </strong>
        <br />
        Some services those I&apos;ve worked on: SES, S3 Bucket, Cloudfront,
        Kinesis, Glue Jobs and Crawlers, API Gateway, Lambda functions, SQS,
        SNS, EC2, ECS and ECR
        <br />
