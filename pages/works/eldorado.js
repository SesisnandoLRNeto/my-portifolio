      <P>
        I am currently working with Angular and Node.js frameworks, leveraging a
        comprehensive set of methodologies and tools to deliver high-quality
        software solutions. My current focus is on developing an Enterprise
        Mobility Management (EMM) system, encompassing various critical aspects
        such as CI/CD, code practices, and leadership roles like Chapter Leads.
        My approach includes: Agile Methodologies: Expert in both
        Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) to
        ensure continuous delivery and iterative progress. Domain-Driven Design
        (DDD): Applying DDD principles to create robust and scalable
        architectures that align closely with business needs, particularly
        within the EMM domain. Unit Testing: Utilizing Jasmine and Karma to
        build and maintain a solid suite of unit tests, ensuring code
        reliability and performance within the EMM system. Automation Testing:
        Proficient with Protractor and Selenium to automate end-to-end testing,
        enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process, crucial
        for maintaining the integrity of the EMM platform. CI/CD & Code
        Practices: Actively involved in implementing CI/CD pipelines and best
        coding practices to streamline development and deployment processes,
        ensuring consistent and high-quality software delivery. Chapter Leads:
        Leading and mentoring teams in best practices, fostering collaboration
        and continuous improvement across the development lifecycle.
